- [x] Route `@Label` handling in `sdk/ccd-config-generator/src/main/java/uk/gov/hmcts/ccd/sdk/generator/CaseFieldGenerator.java` through a helper so the map wiring stays alongside the other annotation code.
- [x] Reuse `CaseFieldTypeResolver` / `CaseFieldAnnotationApplier` when exporting explicit event fields in `CaseFieldGenerator` to avoid diverging type and label logic.
- [ ] Evaluate extracting a dedicated builder around `CaseFieldGenerator.toComplex` to separate recursion, map creation, and annotation enrichment for easier testing.
