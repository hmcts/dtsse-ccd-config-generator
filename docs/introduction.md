# Decentralised Data Persistence — Conceptual Introduction

TL;DR

- Persist case data in a service-owned database while CCD continues to orchestrate callbacks and security controls.
- No big-bang rewrite: keep the familiar AboutToStart / MidEvent / AboutToSubmit / Submitted flow.
- The JSON payload stays intact—only the storage location and responsibility boundaries change.
- Service teams regain ownership of schema, performance tuning, and migration cadence.
- The SDK supplies migrations, transaction orchestration, idempotency, and optional Elasticsearch sync to smooth onboarding.


## As-is: centralised persistence

CCD orchestrates events and invokes service callbacks.

Each callback receives the full case JSON blob, performs validation, mutation, and side effects (emails, integrations, etc.), then returns a (possibly) changed blob to CCD for persistence.

CCD persists this blob verbatim in its case_data table.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
autonumber
participant UI as UI
participant CCD
participant Svc as Service

    UI->>CCD: Trigger Event (caseId, event)
    CCD->>Svc: POST callback(JSON)
    Svc-->>CCD: Return JSON' (validated/mutated)
    CCD-->>UI: Next state / response
```

## The decentralised option

CCD continues to orchestrate events and invokes service callbacks, but the service becomes the source of truth for case data.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
autonumber
participant UI as UI
participant CCD
participant Svc as Service
participant SDB as Service DB

    UI->>CCD: Trigger Event (caseId, event)
    CCD->>Svc: Read current case_data
    CCD->>Svc: POST /submit (JSON)
    Note right of Svc: Validate & mutate JSON<br/>Side effects (emails, integrations)
    Svc->>SDB: Save case_data = ... 
    Svc-->>CCD: Return JSON' (for immediate UI/state)
    CCD-->>UI: response
```

- CCD loads your case type's data from your service instead of its case_data table.
- Your service persists both the authoritative case record and the event history inside your database (see schema overview).
- CCD still enforces authorisation, event definitions, and callback sequencing; you take on data modelling, retention, and migrations.

### What changes for teams

- **Database provisioning:** Allocate a PostgreSQL database for your service to persist its case data
- **Schema migrations:** The SDK provides Flyway scripts to create and manage a 'ccd' schema that resides in your database.
- **Read APIs:** Implement `CaseView<ViewType, StateEnum>` so CCD can read case data from your service
- **Write to your database:** You can write to your database during the standard CCD event lifecycle callbacks
